        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef or Italian sausage and cook until browned, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and parsley. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping each noodle.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering with sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
